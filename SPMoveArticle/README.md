How to Lose Metadata and Alienate Documents (Source)
====================================================

This is the PowerShell that I used to create the source files for my article
"[How to Lose Metadata and Alienate
Documents](https://mikehatheway.com/2019/03/25/how-to-lose-metadata-and-alienate-documents/)".

The PowerShell requires the [SharePointPnP.PowerShell
Commands](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell).

The script itself was written quickly and uses passwords stored in plain text,
so it's not meant to be a production ready script.
